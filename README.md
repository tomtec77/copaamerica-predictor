Predict results of the Copa America.

My attempt at building a football predictor model in a VERY short amount of time
(I only have 4 days to create it).

## Data sources

Match results between 1995-01-01 and 2015-01-01 have been collected from the
FIFA website 

http://es.fifa.com/worldfootball/results/male.html

only for countries that participate in the Copa America and for the following
types of competition:

- FIFA World Cup
- Qualifiers for the FIFA World Cup
- Copa Am√©rica
- CONCACAF Gold Cup
- FIFA Confederations Cup
